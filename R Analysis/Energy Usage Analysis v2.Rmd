## Objectives

This report looks at the use of solar energy during September 2024 in a domestic property in the southern highlands of Scotland. The property previously used oil for heating and electricity for lighting plus cooking but this was changed in order to reduce running costs and the carbon-footprint of the property. A solar array, battery and ground source heat pump were installed in order to attempt to rely solely on solar generated electricity and supplemented with import from the electricity grid only to compensate for short-falls.

The main aims of this data analysis is to answer the following questions:

1.  How effectively does the solar generation cover energy consumption?
2.  When specifically does the solar generation fall short and require grid import?
3.  Would additional battery storage capacity cover these shortfalls?
4.  Does the installation meet the expectations at the time of purchase?

***WIP - Analysis, expected conclusions:***

1)  Consumption is covered by solar .. or not? how much? how much grid still needed
2)  Consumption is linked to temperature and house occupancy
3)  Solar generation is linked to irradiance .. but how much?
4)  Any other links such as temperature? .. probably not usage or occupancy though?
5)  ?? Cannot account for Â£ cost and different costs at times of day .. battery importing then for example
6)  ?? Battery timing in and out complicates the analysis?
7)  Increased battery will smooth out across days? forecast storage/impact .. but can't see the intra-day detail to better analyse
8)  Solar generation meets the forecasts at purchase .. need original data/estimates!?

## Summary of The Data

The data analysed comprises four parts, all daily data, 30 observations, for each day in September 2024:

-   Weather: Temperature and solar irradiance readings
-   Energy Use: Electricity consumption
-   Energy Source: The source of electricity: solar, battery or import from the grid
-   *Occupied*: The approximate number of hours the house is occupied each day

All data and supporting files can be found online at [Github](https://github.com/StuartG24/Home-Solar-Usage-Analysis).

### Weather

Weather data is sourced from the [Balquhidder Weather Station](https://www.blscc.org/weather) and consists of:

-   *Temp* - the mean daily temperature in $^\circ$C and is derived from 6 readings taken at 4 hourly intervals over a 24 hour period
-   *Irrdnce* - irradiance, a measure of the solar energy experienced over a specified area, units are W/m$^2$ and is used to calculate the theoretical power generated from an array of solar panels[^1]

[^1]: Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance>

### Energy Use & Source

The distribution of power for the house is managed by a Tesla Powerwall and Controller and an iPhone app is used to monitor this, see Figure 1. All electricity data was downloaded via this app. Electricity is measured in kWh.

Electricity used and where it is sourced from:

-   *Home_Total* - total energy used by the house
-   *From_Solar* - solar power generated by an array of 36 solar panels
-   *From_PWall* - battery storage
-   *From_Grid* - the national power grid

Electricity generated by the solar panels and where it is used (the controller then intelligently makes the routing decisions):

-   *Solar_Total* - total energy generated by the solar panels
-   *To_Home* - consumption by the house
-   *To_PWall* - for battery storage
-   *To_Grid* - export to the national power grid

## Initial Data Examination

***TO DO:** Tidy up table columns display .... look at Pandoc options etc to change layout for table and whole document? <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#synopsis>*

Once the sources of data have been collated and loaded the dataset consists of 30 observations and 12 columns. The first 6 rows are shown below:

```{r, size="small"}
# Display the first 6 rows of the data
#kable(head(energy_df), caption = 'First 6 Rows of the source dataset')
head(energy_df)
```

Some simple visualisations were then used to better understand the data and see if there were any obvious relationships to explore further.

-   A bar plot of the total daily usage and its source (Solar, Battery, Grid)

-   Similarly for generation each day and how it was directed (Directly used, stored in battyer, exported to the grid ..

-   ?? overlay temp, irradiance, solar generation

-   ?? Overlay temperture and occupation over house usage

-   ?? Overlay irradiance and solar generation

```{r, fig.cap="Daily Energy Usage & Source of the Energy"}

barplot(matrix(energy_df$temp), names.arg=energy_df$date)
```

```{r, fig.cap="First plot", out.width="90%"}
plot(energy_df$To_Home ~ energy_df$Date, type = 'l', col = 'red')
lines(energy_df$Date, energy_df$Temp, type = 'l', col = "blue")
lines(energy_df$Date, energy_df$Occupied*20, type = 'h', col = "green")
legend("topright", legend = c("Home", "Temp", "Occupied"), 
       col = c("red", "blue", "green"), lty = 1)
```

```{r, fig.cap="Second plot", out.width="90%"}
plot(energy_df$Date, energy_df$From_Solar, type = 'l', col = "red")
lines(energy_df$Date, energy_df$Irrdnce/150, type = 'l', col = "blue")
legend("topright", legend = c("Solar", "Irradiance", "xx"), 
       col = c("red", "blue", "green"), lty = 1)
